# Morse Code Converter Project

This Python application converts text input into Morse code using predefined character and Morse code lists.
The application takes user input, processes it and outputs the corresponding Morse code.

## Key Features

**Character and Morse Code Mapping:**
  - The application uses two lists: one for characters and another for their corresponding Morse code representations. This mapping allows for easy conversion from text to Morse code.

**User Input Handling:**
  - The application prompts the user to enter a string, which is then converted to uppercase to match the character list.

**Morse Code Conversion Logic:**
  - The application iterates through each letter in the user input, finds its corresponding Morse code representation, and appends it to the final output list.

**Output the Result:**
  - The application joins the Morse code representations into a single string and prints the final output.
